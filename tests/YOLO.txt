YOLO - Object Detection

- Uses 4 convolutional neural networks. Can process images at upto 155fps. Can be used
real-time.
- Image is first divided into an SxS grid and within each grid, YOLO will predict the 
locations, sizes and confidence scores of the predetermined number of bounding boxes
detecting the class and place of where an object can be. 
- Each bounding box will have 5 predictions:
	- x coordinate
	- y coordinate
	- width
	- height
	- confidence
